> Universal TypeScript starter kit for Angular 2 and React

Fast, reliable TypeScript development stack for building [Angular 2.0](https://angularjs.org/) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) applications
based on webpack using TypeScript 1.9x together with Babel (async/await and generators in ES5).

**Note!** If you only need a super fast TypeScript 2.0 workflow. Take a look at [Sikky](https://github.com/Kflash/sikky). It's another repo I'm maintaining. Supporting all new TypeScript features.

## Features

- [x] Uses TypeScript 2.0 Pre
- [x] Statically typed build system for working with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [x] Maintain a consistent code style with [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)
- [x] Production and development builds.
- [x] Intelligent code editing with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [x] Mock modules for testing purposes with [Rewire](https://github.com/speedskater/babel-plugin-rewire)
- [x] Run test doubles with [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/)
- [x] Sample unit tests with Mocha and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) including code coverage via [istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/).
- [x] Following the [best practices](https://angular.io/styleguide).
- [x] Manager of your type definitions using [typings](https://github.com/typings/typings).
- [x] ES7 to ES5 transpilation with [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
- [x] Test Driven Development (TDD)
- [x] Async and await
- [x] Code coverage report with [Istanbul Instrumenter Loader](https://github.com/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader)
- [x] Sourcemap
- [x] Let you play with `CSS`, `LESS`, `SASS`, `HTML`, and `JSON`
- [x] Mocha & chai de facto standard

## Quick start

The only development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). So just make sure you have it installed. Then
type few commands known to every Node developer...

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/trixler/trixly.git
cd trixly
# install the project's dependencies
npm install

# dev build
npm run build:dev
# prod build
npm run build:prod
```
... and boom! You have it all setup for you!

## Workflow

* `npm run build` - build bundle both for development and production
* `npm run build:dev` -  builds bundle for development
* `npm run build:prod` - builds bundle for production
* `npm run test` - runs all tests using Karma & Mocha
* `npm run test:phantom` - runs the unit tests for browser with PhantomJS
* `npm run test:chrome` - runs the unit tests for browser with Chrome
* `npm run test:node` - runs the unit tests in the `node.js` environment
* `npm run clean` - remove the coverage report - and the dist folder
* `npm run clean:dist` - remove the dist folder
* `npm run prebuild:dev` - clear the dist folder and generate a non-minified script
* `npm run watch` - run all unit tests, and watch files for changes
* `npm run watch:node` - run all unit tests in the `node.js` environemnt, and watch files for changes
* `npm run watch:browser` - run all unit tests for browser and watch files for changes
* `npm run watch:chrome` - run all unit tests for browser with Chrome and watch files for changes
* `npm run lint` - validates all TypeScript files using tslint
* `npm run lint:src` - validates the source files
* `npm run lint:tests` - validates the unit tests
* `npm run browser` - runs browser unit tests in the browser.
* `npm run dependencies:check` - shows a list over dependencies with a higher version number then the current one - if any
* `npm run dependencies:upgrade` - automatically upgrade all devDependencies & dependencies, and update package.json

### Browser tests

The browser spec runner - `./config/runner.html` - can be opened in a browser to run your tests. For it to work, you must first run `npm run browser`, and then
open `port 8080`. This will set up a watch task that will automatically refresh the tests when your scripts, or the tests, change.
